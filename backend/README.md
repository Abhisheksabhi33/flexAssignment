#### Why This Schema Design fulfills the requirements of the Yoga Class Managment System

### Database Schema Overview

The provided database schema caters to the functionalities outlined in the problem statement for managing enrollments in a Yoga Class Admission System. Here's how the schema justifies the requirements:

1. **User Information Storage:**
   - The `Users` table efficiently stores vital user detailsâ€”`Name`, `Age`, `Email`, and `Phone`. These fields are crucial for registering individuals for Yoga Classes.

2. **Enrollment Tracking:**
   - `Enrollment` table facilitates enrollment management, linking users through `UserID` to their chosen `Batch` (6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM, or 5-6PM) time slots, aligning perfectly with participant preferences.

3. **Date Management for Enrollments:**
   - `EnrollmentDate` records user enrollments regardless of the day, adhering to the requirement for flexible enrollment within the month.
   - `LastBatchChangeDate` regulates batch changes for the following month, ensuring changes aren't permitted for the current month.

4. **Payment Tracking:**
   - `LastPaymentDate` diligently monitors the most recent payment made by users, complying with the requirement for monthly fee payments.

5. **Payment Status Indicator:**
   - `PaymentStatus` serves as a binary indicator ('T' for True and 'F' for False) representing whether the monthly fee has been settled.

6. **Constraints and Validations:**
   - Mandatory constraints (`NOT NULL`) on critical fields (Name, Age, Email, Phone) enforce complete user information during enrollment.
   - `CHECK` constraints on `Age` and `Batch` validate age boundaries and acceptable batch options.

7. **Primary and Foreign Keys:**
   - Strong relationships using primary (`ID`) and foreign keys (`UserID`) maintain data integrity and accurately reference user enrollment records.

This schema design aptly captures essential user details, manages enrollments and payments, and aligns precisely with the Yoga Classes admission system's requirements.
